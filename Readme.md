Hashing files is a good way to check if a file's integrity is good, to know if anyone has modified the contents of that data.
In security often times in online Games they use anti-cheats and anti-hacks where the antihack would do a hash check on it's files
to make sure the files has not been modified to either bypass the antihack and to prevent variable change of values such as HP, movement speed and etc.
